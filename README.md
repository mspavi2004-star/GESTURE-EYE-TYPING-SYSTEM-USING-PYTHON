The Gesture Eye Typing System using Python is an assistive technology project that allows users to type on a computer using only their eye movements. It is mainly designed for people who have physical disabilities and cannot use a keyboard or mouse. The system works by using a webcam to capture real-time video of the user’s face and eyes. With the help of Python libraries such as OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system detects facial landmarks and tracks the movement of the eyes. A virtual keyboard is displayed on the screen, and when the user looks at a particular letter for a few seconds or performs a blink gesture, that letter is selected and typed automatically. The selected letters form words and sentences, which are shown as text output on the screen. This system is cost-effective because it requires only a basic webcam and a computer. It is widely used in assistive communication, healthcare support systems, and human-computer interaction research. In the future, the system can be improved by adding AI-based faster detection, word prediction features, and multi-language support to make typing quicker and more efficient.
